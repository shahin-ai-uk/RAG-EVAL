Initially, it led to a decline in demand for Mobility rides due to various governmental restrictions, quarantines, and travel limitations. However, the pandemic also led to an increase in food delivery orders, resulting in a 66% growth in Delivery Gross Bookings in 2021, driven by stay-at-home orders and expansion into new markets. Mobility Gross Bookings also recovered, growing 36% in 2021, as the business rebounded from the pandemic's impacts. Overall, Uber's Gross Bookings increased by $32.5 billion in 2021, up 56% compared to 2020.\n",
