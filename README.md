# RAG-EVAL
Unlike standard RAG tutorials, this project implements an Automated Evaluation Pipeline (LLM-as-a-Judge). Every answer generated by the system is instantly graded for Faithfulness (did it hallucinate?) and Relevance (did it answer the user's question?), ensuring high reliability for financial data applications.
