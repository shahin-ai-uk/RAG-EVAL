## Project Overview
**RAG-Eval** is a production-grade **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline designed to answer complex questions from financial 10-K reports. 

Unlike standard RAG tutorials, this project implements an **Automated Evaluation Pipeline (LLM-as-a-Judge)**. Every answer generated by the system is instantly graded for **Faithfulness** (did it hallucinate?) and **Relevance** (did it answer the user's question?), ensuring high reliability for financial data applications.

## Key Features
* **Vector Search Engine:** Ingests and chunks PDF financial reports (Uber 2021 10-K) into a **ChromaDB** vector store using HuggingFace embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
* **LLM Judge Integration:** Implemented a secondary "Grader Agent" (Llama-3-70B) that scores the main model's outputs on a 0-1 scale.
* **Hallucination Detection:** Automatically flags answers that are not supported by the retrieved context.
* **Context-Aware Retrieval:** Uses recursive character splitting to maintain semantic context across document chunks.

## Tech Stack
* **Orchestration:** LangChain
* **LLM Engine:** Groq API (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
* **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (Local)
* **Embeddings:** HuggingFace (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* **Document Processing:** PyPDFLoader

## Evaluation Benchmarks
The system was benchmarked on 4 distinct categories of financial queries. Below are the actual automated grades generated by the system:

| Query Category | Question | Faithfulness Score | Relevance Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financials** | *"What was Uber's total revenue for 2021?"* | **1.0 (Perfect)** | **1.0 (Perfect)** |
| **Risk Analysis** | *"What are the primary risks to Uber's business?"* | **1.0 (Perfect)** | **1.0 (Perfect)** |
| **Macro Impact** | *"How did COVID-19 impact Gross Bookings?"* | **0.9 (High)** | **1.0 (Perfect)** |
| **Legal** | *"Status of driver classification proceedings?"* | **1.0 (Perfect)** | **1.0 (Perfect)** |

### Sample Evaluation Output
```text
Question: How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact Uber's Gross Bookings?

Answer: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact... initially leading to a decline in demand...

EVALUATION REPORT:
Faithfulness: 0.9
Relevance: 1.0
Explanation: The answer is derived almost entirely from the context with minor rephrasing...
